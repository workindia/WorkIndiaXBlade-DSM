Add support for exporting component sets and variants as individual icon components. Component sets will now export each variant as a separate icon with proper naming that includes the parent component set name and variant type (e.g., "Call-FillIcon", "Call-OutlineIcon"). Variant names are derived from variant properties for cleaner naming.
